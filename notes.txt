A file tracker (like Windows Auditing) even with process IDs isn't good enough because there could be other processes accessing files (like backup processes). So need to build up a process tree. So need to use process tracking.

>Using Procmon because it's windows supported. The other ones don't work consistently as this is a undocumented area of Windows and is a moving target.
Other Windows process Trackers:
-StraceNT (Win32) http://ih.logicodu.com/default.asp?BH=projects&H=strace.htm. Got "Error: The request is not supported". Maybe try again?
-WinDbg's Logger.exe http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff552060(v=vs.85).aspx (though these are just library and not system calls)
-Windows Events http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ee412263.aspx
-Dr Memory STrace for Windows http://www.drmemory.org/strace_for_windows.html
-NtTrace (Native API) http://www.howzatt.demon.co.uk/NtTrace/
-Apimon (MS) said couldn't start program after I had selected (opened) it.
